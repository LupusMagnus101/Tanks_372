There were many things I wanted to include in this assignment, but I ran out of time to complete them all. 
This project was a valuable learning experience, especially in understanding how AI interacts with nav meshes and how it can pathfind using different setups. 
One thing I found frustrating was the structure of the Unity tutorial video—at times, it was unclear, and certain features simply didn’t work as expected.
I did like the free stuff that I can use for other potject going forward
